    Iâ€™m a bot that helps you create task lists just like in Telegram, but without Premium!

    Below, you can create your task list.
    Or, you can do it by using <code>@{ $bot_username } Task list name [option 1] [option 2] [option 3]</code> in <b>any</b> chat!

start-msg = <b>Hi, { $user }</b>

confirm-btn = Confirm

not-found = Not found

invalid-id = Invalid id

not-allowed = You're not allowed to do this
